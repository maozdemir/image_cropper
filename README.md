# image_cropper
A small Python script that uses OpenCV for detecting if the input images have faces that can fill at least 70% of a 512x512 frame.

Useful for creating custom LoRA's for Stable Diffusion.

Can be modified for detecting different objects.

## Usage
Place your images in the `pics/` folder, and run the script.
